# 🇦🇺 Australia Travel Guide

## 📍 Overview

## General Things of Note

- The UV index is insane. Wear sunscreen and wear a hat. Buy sunscreen there - it's better than in the United States.

- When I went (August 2024), the exchange rate was 1.50 AUD to 1 USD, or alternatively 0.66 USD to 1 AUD. This effectively means you can take the AUD price of anything and multiply it by 2/3 to get the USD price.

- Taxes are included in any listed prices at places such as restaurants and grocery stores. Tipping culture is slowly seeping into Australia, but still generally not expected. Some restaurants may charge a service fee. More common is that restaurants and coffee shops have a weekend and public holiday surcharge ranging from 5-10%.

- No alcohol is sold at grocery stores, only at bottle shops. Not even beer or wine. It also can't be sold past 10PM. Alcohol is very expensive but that doesn't seem to stop people. Although when drinking at bars, remember no tax and no tip.

- The seasons are reversed when compared to the Northern hemisphere. However, there is additional nuance when talking about the Northern parts of Australia that fall in the tropics. Instead of four seasons, or even a summer and winter, they have a wet season and dry season. The most popular tourist destination this affects is Far North Queensland (FNQ), home to Cairns, Daintree, and the Great Barrier Reef. If you plan on visiting these areas, or any areas in the Top End or the outback, make sure to go between May and October.

## Getting Around

Within the biggest cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth), public transit is generally quite good. However, for traveling to more remote areas, or for greater flexibility, you're going to want to hire a car.

Domestic flights in Australia are generally much cheaper than the United States. The Melbourne-Sydney corridor is also one of the most flown corridors in the whole world. It's possible to take the train between Australian cities, but it's generally not your best option. For example, the train between Melbourne and Sydney is 11 hours long, while the flight is 1.5 hours. 

## 🍽 Food

If there's any cuisine that Australia does well, it's definitely breakfast.

Compared to the United States, Australian fast food is quite good! I was not disappointed by any fast food meal I had.

- **Must Try Dishes**:
  - Vegemite toast
  - Lamingtons (dessert sponge cake)
  - Tim Tams (and any Arnott's biscuits)
  - Fish & chips on the beach

## Drink

- beers to look out for
- pubs called hotels and why
- pokies
- alcohol laws

## Shopping

- Kmart
- Woolworths, Cole's, Big W

## Coffee

What people will tell you is that Australians take coffee seriously - and they're absolutely correct. Anywhere that serves coffee will most likely have trained staff pulling espresso shots on an Italian espresso machine. The baseline level of quality is quite high. For those interested in specialty coffee specifically, you will have many options, but rest assured that you will nonetheless be quite satisfied by an arbitrary coffee shop near you.

Filter coffee, while available at specialty shops, is less common in Australia; espresso drinks are preferred. Instead of an Americano, order a long black. Instead of a capuccino, order a flat white. In Australia, a capuccino is a latte with chocolate sprinkles on top.

For a more comprehensive treatment of Australian coffee and recommendations for specific shops, that will be covered in its own section.

## Sydney

It's alternately both an Australian San Francisco but also a better London. It's a world-class city for a reason.

### Getting around

For Sydney proper, public transit is excellent. The system is called Opal. You can get a physical card or use tap to pay on your phone.

## FNQ (Cairns, Daintree, Port Douglas, Great Barrier Reef)

The closest comparison I can make to another travel destination I've been to is Florida. Humid but with comfortable temperatures, beautiful nature, dangerous animals, interesting characters, pensioners, partying backpackers, and a general culture of rugged individualism. FNQ is in the tropics and instead of summer and winter has a wet and dry season. Don't go during wet season; it's a rainforest and it will be raining a lot. During the dry season, it's temperate and beautiful.

The main attractions are really about the nature. This area of Australia has rainforest, beaches, the great barrier reef, and the outback all in close proximity. Unfortunately, the only real way to get the full experience is to rent a car. Luckily, the prices are not that bad and driving on the left is barely a hindrance. Many roads are wide and a lot of it will be highway driving.

### Great Barrier Reef

You can see the reef from many places, but on my trip we chose to take a boat from Port Douglas. The main choices you have to make when seeing the reef are whether you would like to see the inner or outer reef, as well as whether you would like to snorkel or dive. The outer reef (which we did) is about an hour and a half away from Port Doublas by boat, and going to see the reef is an all day affair. The company we went with had 70 customers on the boat excluding the crew; They took us to three different reef sites and also served lunch and snacks along the way.

### Daintree National Park

The Daintree rainforest is huge and older than the Amazon! You can visit it via the National Park. The two main attractions are Mossman Gorge and Cape Tribulation. Ideally, you would be driving a 4WD vehicle through the park. While it's possible to see everything in a day, it might leave you feeling a little bit "beached out" or "rainforested out" after seeing so many. Each stop in the park feels like its own ecosystem. If you're up for it, you can camp in the park. 

Mossman -> Wonga Beach -> Cow Bay

### Hartley's Crocodile Adventure

### Cairns

### Port Douglas

Port Douglas is a sleepy resort town. Most things close at 9. But you get much more convenient access to Daintree, the reef, and some really excellent beaches. If you plan on doing full-day trips to those things, you'll probably want to stay here.
